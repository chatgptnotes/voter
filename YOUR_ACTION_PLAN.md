## 📋 TODAY (30 minutes)

### Step 1: Set Up Real Database

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Login to your account
   - Select project: `iwtgbseaoztjbnvworyq`

2. **Open SQL Editor:**
   - Click "SQL Editor" in left sidebar
   - Click "New Query"

3. **Run the Migration:**
   - Open this file on your computer:
     ```
     /Users/apple/Downloads/Pulseofpeoplevoter23oct/supabase/migrations/20251028_add_rbac_system.sql
     ```
   - Copy ALL the contents
   - Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" or press Cmd+Enter

4. **Wait for Success:**
   - You should see: "Success. No rows returned"
   - This creates 7 new tables for RBAC

### Step 2: Create Your Super Admin

In Supabase SQL Editor, run:

```sql
-- Create your super admin user
INSERT INTO users (
  name,
  email,
  role,
  is_super_admin,
  status,
  permissions
)
VALUES (
  'Your Name',
  'your.email@example.com',
  'super_admin',
  TRUE,
  'active',
  ARRAY[]::TEXT[]
)
ON CONFLICT (email) DO UPDATE
SET
  role = 'super_admin',
  is_super_admin = TRUE;
```

Replace `'Your Name'` and `'your.email@example.com'` with your details!

### Step 3: Test Real Login

Now you need to create this user in Supabase Auth:

1. In Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
2. Click "Add User"
3. Enter the same email you used above
4. Create a password
5. Click "Create User"

Now you can login with real authentication!

## 🎯 Key Concepts to Understand

### 1. Role Hierarchy
```
Super Admin (Level 1)
├── Admin (Level 2)
│   ├── Manager (Level 3)
│   │   ├── Analyst (Level 4)
│   │   ├── User (Level 5)
│   │   ├── Viewer (Level 6)
│   │   └── Volunteer (Level 7)
```

Higher-level roles can manage lower-level roles.

### 2. Permission System
Every action is controlled by permissions:
- `view_analytics` - Can view analytics
- `export_data` - Can export data
- `manage_users` - Can manage users
- etc. (33 total permissions)

### 3. Multi-Tenant Model
Each organization is isolated:
- Kerala BJP → Their own database
- Tamil Nadu Congress → Their own database
- Super Admin → Can see all
